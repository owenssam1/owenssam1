# About Me

Hi there! My name is Samuel Owens. 

ðŸ“š My research in ecological modeling. I develop mulit-scale modeling frameworks, one of which I am currently applying to the invasive Spotted Lanternfly (Lycorma delicatula). I am interested in the effects of climate change on invasive spread.

ðŸ’¼ I am a Graduate Research and Teaching Assistant at Temple University and I work with the [iEcoLab](https://github.com/ieco-lab).
